#The Beginning#

Day one, Fundamentals of Programming and I have no idea what's going on. The instructor tells me
to take a seat at a PC and open up TextPad. Out comes the pen and paper and I await further
instructions. "Daire, open up TextPad on the PC" says the instructor. Lovely. After repeated
"could not load or find class main" messages, there it was...."Hello World". Success! "I'm going to be a
millionaire but how will I spend the money?". Weeks went past and I realised there's a little bit more to this
programming thing than I thought....Time to get serious! A million dodgy 'for', 'if' and 'while' statements later
it was done. The cinema ticket program was complete and ready for users at the local cinema. It was a done deal.
Fundamentals of Programming 2 was next on the list. After one class I realised something. Maybe the cinema program wasn't
ready for the world. I realised that the 800 lines of code in my 'main' method probably wasn't the best approach. Then the
enlightening moment happens when you are introduced to the object orientated paradigm and all is good with the world again.
Maybe I'll be a millionaire after all.
