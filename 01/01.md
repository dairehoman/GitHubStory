#The Beginning#

Day one, Fundamentals of Programming and I have no idea what's going on. The instructor tells me
to take a seat at a PC and open up TextPad. Out comes the pen and paper and I await further
instructions. "Daire, open up TextPad on the PC" says the instructor. Lovely. After repeated
"could not load or find class main" messages, there it was...."Hello World".
