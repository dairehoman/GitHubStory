#The Middle#

Along came 'gets' and 'sets' and encapsulation and all of its benefits. As part of the package deal, one thing could inherit from another.
Easy stuff! An animal has properties and Gizmo the dog can inherit properties from the Animal. A million Vehicles, Dogs, Cats, Motorbikes and contructors
later, that was it, I was the ultimate programmer. NOW it was time to make my millions. It was all well and good doing everything in the
console but I soon realised that there was these things called GUI's. No it wasn't the stuff inside jaffa cakes either. It was all about buttons and boxes, panels and panes and
sliders and scrollers. Everything was so much easier on the command line......A million cardlayouts and JPanels later that was it, NOW
IM READY TO BE A MILLIONAIRE!!! I handed up my assignment and I was expecting a job offer on the spot. All I got was "You probably could have done that in it's own thread".
 Here we go again.... Maybe the whole threading thing will be handy no need to panic... Well it wasn't handy, it was the opposite. A hundred NullPointer exceptions later that was it, I got 'Hello' printing on one thread and 'world' printing in the other. Show me the money.
