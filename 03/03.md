#The End#
 
At this stage I've come to realise that there's a lot more to this. The deeper I get into this whole programming thing, the more I realise it's going to present lots of problems no matter what corner I turn. There's so much to consider, theres 100 different patterns and paradigms and no specific one is the magic 'one-fits-all' approach that everybody is seeking. It's just a case of breaking each problem into 10 small problems and starting at problem one. Where there was a time that I thought I had it figured out, I realised that the road to becoming a 'programmer' was a much longer one than I had first anticipated. The key to it all was embracing each error as it came and treat it like it was a good thing. Errors are good....kind of. Once that mindset was adopted, it opened a new thinking process on how to be patient with programming and how everything is a process of small steps. Maybe one day I'll be a millionaire engineer. The good news is that I've realised, it's not today. But if I take it a day at a time, one problem at a time and keep learning one thing every day, who knows what type of a programmer i'll be in a few years.
