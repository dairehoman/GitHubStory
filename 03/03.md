#The End#
 
At this stage I've come to realise that there's a lot more to this. The deeper I get into this whole programming thing, the more I realise it's going to present lots of problems no matter what corner I turn. There's so much to consider, theres 100 different patterns and paradigms and no specific one is the magic 'one-fits-all' approach that everybody is seeking. It's just a case of breaking each problem into 10 small problems and starting at problem one.
