#The End#
 
I've come to the conclusion that I've got this programming thing... The employers are knocking on my door, I'M GONNA BE RICH!! Maybe i'll get involved in AI, maybe I'll create the next big app or maybe I'll re-invent the web. Where will I spend the money? Will I invest in new ideas? Or will I just buy a Ferrari and get that part out of my system? Wether it's a Ferrari or a new house, either way, the skills that I have gained are undeniable. The best part of being a programmer is that I can work for myself too. Maybe I'll come up with the next Snapchat, or maybe I'll come up with the next Instagram. Whatever path I choose will be a new journey and a new opportunity. The journey to become a good programmer is a hard one...But it'll be worth the Ferrari...It's not for everyone, but if anyone likes it, they should pursue it because of the opportunities and doors it will open in their life. So to anyone that likes programming(and Ferrari's) they should take the first step to becoming the best programmer that they can be, and embrace all the mishaps along the way!
