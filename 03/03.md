#The End#
 
I've come to the conclusion that I've got this programming thing... The employers are knocking on my door, I'M GONNA BE RICH!! Maybe i'll get involved in AI, maybe I'll create the next big app or maybe I'll re-invent the web. Where will I spend the money? Will I invest in new ideas? Or will I just buy a Ferrari and get that part out of my system!
