# GitHubStory
A short story written to demonstrate basic uses of local versioning with Git and remote versioning with GitHub.   

The story will be written using Pandoc, a tool that can be used to generate PDF documents from markdown files.   

The story itself:   
My take on Software, how it confused me in the beginning, how it confuses me now and how I predict it'll confuse me in the future...

Will be published on GitHub pages towards deadline...
