# GitHubStory
A short story written to demonstrate basic uses of local versioning with Git and remote versioning with GitHub.   

The story will be written using Pandoc, a tool that can be used to generate PDF documents from markdown files.   

The story itself:   
-> My take on Software, what it means to me, what I thought it used to be, what I think it is now and what I think it'll be in the future...

Will be published on GitHub pages towards deadline...
