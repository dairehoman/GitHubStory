<h3>The Beginning</h3>

<p>
Day one, Fundamentals of Programming and I have no idea what's going on. The instructor tells me
to take a seat at a PC and open up TextPad. Out comes the pen and paper and I await further
instructions. "Daire, open up TextPad on the PC" says the instructor. Lovely. After repeated
"could not load or find class main" messages, there it was...."Hello World". Success! "I'm going to be a
millionaire but how will I spend the money?". Weeks went past and I realised there's a little bit more to this
programming thing than I thought....Time to get serious! A million dodgy 'for', 'if' and 'while' statements later
it was done. The cinema ticket program was complete and ready for users at the local cinema. It was a done deal.
Fundamentals of Programming 2 was next on the list. After one class I realised something. Maybe the cinema program wasn't
ready for the world. I realised that the 800 lines of code in my 'main' method probably wasn't the best approach. Then the
enlightening moment happens when you are introduced to the object orientated paradigm and all is good with the world again.
Maybe I'll be a millionaire after all.

<h3>The Middle</h3>

<p>
Along came 'gets' and 'sets' and encapsulation and all of its benefits. As part of the package deal, one thing could inherit from another.
Easy stuff! An animal has properties and Gizmo the dog can inherit properties from the Animal. A million Vehicles, Dogs, Cats, Motorbikes and contructors
later, that was it, I was the ultimate programmer. NOW it was time to make my millions. It was all well and good doing everything in the
console but I soon realised that there was these things called GUI's. No it wasn't the stuff inside jaffa cakes either. It was all about buttons and boxes, panels and panes and
sliders and scrollers. Everything was so much easier on the command line......A million cardlayouts and JPanels later that was it, NOW
IM READY TO BE A MILLIONAIRE!!! I handed up my assignment and I was expecting a job offer on the spot. All I got was "You probably could have done that in it's own thread".
 Here we go again.... Maybe the whole threading thing will be handy no need to panic... Well it wasn't handy, it was the opposite. A hundred NullPointer exceptions later that was it, I got 'Hello' printing on one thread and 'world' printing in the other. Show me the money. 
</p>

<h3>The End</h3>
 
 <p>
At this stage I've come to realise that there's a lot more to this. The deeper I get into this whole programming thing, the more I realise it's going to present lots of problems no matter what corner I turn. There's so much to consider, theres 100 different patterns and paradigms and no specific one is the magic 'one-fits-all' approach that everybody is seeking. It's just a case of breaking each problem into 10 small problems and starting at problem one. Where there was a time that I thought I had it figured out, I realised that the road to becoming a 'programmer' was a much longer one than I had first anticipated. The key to it all was embracing each error as it came and treat it like it was a good thing. Errors are good....kind of. Once that mindset was adopted, it opened a new thinking process on how to be patient with programming and how everything is a process of small steps. Maybe one day I'll be a millionaire engineer. The good news is that I've realised, it's not today. But if I take it a day at a time, one problem at a time and keep learning one thing every day, who knows what type of a programmer i'll be in a few years.
